<p>The first test of any semester is always the worst: after enjoying weeks of limited responsibility (and in my case, after a crazy-fun snowed-in weekend), you have to buckle down and read about amortization tables and financial ratios and other crap that you don't care so much about. </p>
<p>I have a finance test on Wednesday, so don't expect too much out of me until after that.</p>
