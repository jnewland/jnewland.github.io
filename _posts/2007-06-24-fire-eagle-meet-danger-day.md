instructions are out of date. See
[here](http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2008/03/06/fire-eagle-location-aware-applications-without-the-hassle)
for instructions that work with the new [Fire
Eagle](http://fireeagle.com!</span>)

A couple days ago, a [friend of mine](http://cjmart.in/) sent me an
invite for [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/), [Yahoo!
Research Berkley's](http://yahooresearchberkeley.com/) nifty
closed-Alpha location storage and query engine, and I've been hooked
ever since. For the rest of you without access, here's a brief overview
of what FireEagle does, straight from the
[FAQ](http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/faq.php) page:

> Fire Eagle is a site that keeps track of your current location and
> helps you share it with other sites and services safely. There are
> hundreds of potential applications.

> Fire Eagle allows you to share your locations with other sites and
> services safely, through a secure server - you are always in control.
> You can decide to share your location with any application that can
> use it, and even choose how much detail to give that application
> (exact point, neighborhood, city, state, country).

So, I whipped up a [quick Fire Eagle
Rubygem](http://fireeagle.rubyforge.org/) to make it easier to deal with
Fire Eagle's API. The next logical step? A [twitter
bot](http://twitter.com/dangerday).

### Fire Eagle, meet Danger Day

If you're lucky enough to have an invite to Fire Eagle, here's how you
can use it on Twitter:

1.  Follow [Danger Day](http://twitter.com/dangerday) on Twitter
2.  Sign in to [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/)
3.  [Authorize Danger Day with your FireEagle
    account](http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/authorize.php?appid=FpXV3T9XL3K1orRwoTZ6DKkC7w4-&callback=http://twitter.com/dangerday/statuses/116323112)
4.  Get a
    <a href="http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/displayToken.php?appid=FpXV3T9XL3K1orRwoTZ6DKkC7w4- ">mobile
    token</a> to confirm your authentication with Danger Day
5.  Send a direct message to Danger Day with your token.

Once that's done, you can update your location with a direct message to
Danger Day like so:

-   u Atlanta, GA
-   u Belize
-   u 30022
-   u 123 Anytown USA
-   etc

If you'd like to do this via your mobile phone, make sure your mobile is
[setup with Twitter](http://twitter.com/devices), then send the
following text massage to **40404**, Twitter's short code:

-   d dangerday u Atlanta, GA

To look up the location of someone else using Danger Day:

-   q jnewland
-   q cjmartin
-   q plasticbagUK

or from your mobile:

-   d dangerday q jnewland

### What's next?

I'm getting married in a week, so I leave the creation of cooler Fire
Eagle apps as an exercise to the reader. Extra bonus points if you use
the [Fire Eagle Rubygem](http://fireeagle.rubyforge.org/). If you've got
a great idea for a Fire Eagle app and don't have an invite, get in touch
with me - I might be able to make that happen.

**PS**: If you hack up a Fire Eagle javascript sidebar widget that works
on pages served as application/xml (preferably using the brilliant
[wedje](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/06/widget-deployment-with-wedje)
technique) AND embraces the draft
[geo](http://microformats.org/wiki/geo) microformat, I'll buy you a
pony. Seriously. Here's my location in
<a href="http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/api/queryLoc.php?public=pmCqoI4HI3pIks9n80EN0uXo2GE- ">XML</a>
- go to town.
