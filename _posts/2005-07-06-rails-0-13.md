The web is about to **explode** with exciting new apps. There's a [beta
gem](http://download.rubyonrails.com/) out for the upcoming version 0.13
of [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) , which contains helpers
methods for some crazy AJAX stuff developed by
[script.aculo.us](http://script.aculo.us/demos).

For example, you can make an [auto complete text field with **TWO LINES
OF CODE**](http://script.aculo.us/demos/ajax/autocompleter). Further,
[Drag 'n Drop shopping carts](http://script.aculo.us/demos/shop) are
trivial. This stuff is absolutely nuts.

If you're not into [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com), take a
look **right now**. I'm involved in 4 Ruby on Rails projects right now
(2 personal, 2 for profit) and the small amount of time I invested in
learning RoR is generating amazing returns :)

**UPDATE:** [Ruby on Rails
0.13](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/06/rails-013-225-featuresfixes-in-75-days/)
has been released! Go get it now!
