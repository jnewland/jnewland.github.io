title: Css Naked Day

In support of "web standards":http://www.webstandards.org/ and "CSS Naked Day":http://naked.dustindiaz.com/, the stylesheets on "Soylentfoo":http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/ and my "resume":http://resume.jnewland.com/ have been disabled today, April 5th (Actually, I'm a couple hours early. So sue me).

I take great care in designing the XHTML of both of these sites, and it's a pleasure to be able to show it off. View the source, "validate":http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fsoylentfoo.jnewland.com%2F it, then take a look at your site.

UPDATE: My good friend "Chris Martin":http://cjmart.in/ is celebrating as well.
