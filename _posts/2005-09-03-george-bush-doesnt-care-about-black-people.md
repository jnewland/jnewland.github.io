I don't know about you, but I'm suddenly a bigger Kanye West fan than I
was 10 minutes ago. During NBC's live Katrina benefit concert tonight,
he ignored the teleprompter and spoke emotionally about the governments
neglect for the poor, mostly black refugees in New Orleans while a
flabbergasted Mike Myers looked on. Mike recovered and continued from
the prompter for a minute, after which Kanye dropped the bomb:

> *"George Bush doesn't care about black people"*

Wow. I don't know what to say, other than to tell you to [watch this
video right now](http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/09/02.html#a4762).

Big props to Kanye for having the guts to speak the truth, even when
it's not what (the government wants) people want to hear.

**UPDATE:** Sure enough, [NBC censored Kanye's
remarks](http://www.crooksandliars.com/005/09/02.html#a4764) on the
time-delayed showing of the event shown on the west coast.
