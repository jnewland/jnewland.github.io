title: Tweet - Update Twitter via Quicksilver
---
"Tweet":http://www.sauria.com/blog/2007/01/18/growlified-tweet/, a Twitter Quicksilver Action, is my favorite "Twitter":http://twitter.com updating vehicle as of late - except for one thing. It uses Keychain Scripting to access your saved "Twitterrific":http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific username and password - which, for some ungodly reason, takes about 30 seconds on my Mac Book Pro.

I've made some updates to "Tweet.scpt":http://files.jnewland.com/tweet.scpt.zip to fix the slowness:

* Now uses the "Twitter Rubygem":http://twitter.rubyforge.org/ to talk to Twitter
* Uses the username and password stored in @~/.twitter@, via the Twitter Gem
* Uses <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>'s icon, if you have it installed.

h3. Requirements

* "Growl":http://growl.info/
* "Rubygems":http://rubygems.org/read/chapter/3
* "Twitter Rubygem":http://twitter.rubyforge.org/
** @sudo gem install twitter@

h3. Installation Directions

# Download "Tweet.scpt":http://files.jnewland.com/tweet.scpt.zip
# Move @Tweet.scpt@ to @~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions@
# Restart Quicksilver (Cmd+Ctrl+Q)
# Setup a Trigger - I use Cmd+Opt+Ctrl+T :<br /><br />!http://files.jnewland.com/tweet.png!

This, combined with "Twitter Monitor":http://al3x.net/entries/766, is the way I'm using Twitter most often these days. Like it "or not":http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/01/21/the-twitters/, I think "Twitter":http://twitter.com has a lot of "potential":http://twitter.com/blog/2006/08/have-your-quake-and-twitter-it-too.html. I'd love to throw some AI at the trends of public twitters - you'd see the string "coffee" grow in popularity in the AM and wane in the PM. Add Geocoding support - a way to set your 'Location' as well as your status - and Twitter becomes useful in another dimension. I'm interested to see what Twitter has in it's future.
