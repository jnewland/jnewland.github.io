While listening to podcasts on [Odeo](http://odeo.com) at work I
stumbled across this error <del>massage</del> message:

<br />

<blockquote>
Odeo's database servers are taking a quick break to get a massage.

We like to keep our databases happy, and to do so we make sure they get
regular rejuvenation breaks. Odeo wants to keep it's databases happy and
we understand that taking a break can't be run on a strict clock...Our
databases will be happy to serve you as soon as they&nbsp;come back
online.

Did you know that we've named all of servers after streets in the
mission district of San Francisco?

</blockquote>
Very rarely does an *error message* make you feel *good* about a
website, but I like [Odeo](http://odeo.com) better after seeing that
error. It makes me feel all fuzzy inside, is built with
[Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com), **and** has [Science
Friday's](http://www.sciencefriday.com/) podcast! :)
