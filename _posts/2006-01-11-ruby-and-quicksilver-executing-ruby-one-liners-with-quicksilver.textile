To plug Ruby directly into your brain,  take three short breaths, mutter a prayer to Matz, and then follow these instructions:

<em>Prerequisites: "Mac OS X":http://www.apple.com/macosx/ Panther or greater and "Quicksilver":http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/ </em>


<ol>
<li>Download this humble <a href="http://files.jnewland.com/neural_ruby.zip">Applescript</a>
{% highlight ruby %}
#<using terms from application "Quicksilver"
	on process text t
		do shell script "ruby -00 -e '" & t & "'"
	end process text
end using terms from{% endhighlight %}</li>
<li>Unzip the script and copy it to @~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions/@</li>
<li>Restart Quicksilver</li>
</ol>

Once you've plugged in, Ruby is just a blink away: 

<ol>
<li>Invoke Quicksilver (@CTRL-Space@)</li>
<li>Type a period (@.@) followed by your one-line stroke of genius, such as:
{% highlight ruby %}
#<[ "in", "me", "plug" ].reverse_each {|x| print x.upcase, " " }{% endhighlight %}</li>
<li>Press @TAB@</li>
<li>Type until @ruby@ is displayed in the second pane</li>
<li>Press @Return@</li>
</ol>

The results of your Ruby one-liner ('@PLUG ME IN@' in this case) are placed back into the first pane of Quicksilver for your digestion.
