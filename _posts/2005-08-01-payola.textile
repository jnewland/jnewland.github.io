Here's a great read about "payola":http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050730/RTHEWEEK30/TPBusiness/General - def. _*payola*, noun: why commercial radio stations play shitty music_. via a great "Blogs of War":http://blogsofwar.com post, which reminds me of one of my favorite HST quotes:

<blockquote>_"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench. A long plastic hallway where pimps and thieves run free and good men die like dogs. There is also a negative side."_ - Hunter S. Thompson</blockquote>
