Wow. From my freshly updated [Google
Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) stats, we have my US visits
breakdown by state:

![](http://files.jnewland.com/states.png)

Amazing! Georgia's my \#1 state, with Montana at \#2 and New York and
California tied for 3rd.

Funny Google should release this during
[sweeps](http://gigaom.com/2005/11/11/sweeps-whatev/), the portion of
the year in which TV stations run feature news packages and show lame
flicks like [Category 6](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428144/) in hopes
that [Nielsen's](http://nielsenmedia.com/) minions will scribble about
them in their journal.

[Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) makes a real mockery of
what TV stations pay Nielsen so much for. These are the **real
numbers**, not samples.

This now allows web publishers to provide **detailed** target market
information to advertisers without paying expensive market research
companies. Provided with this thorough information from internet media
entities, advertising agencies will be much more confident spending
money on internet ads.

[The
returns](http://particletree.com/notebook/google-kicks-it-up-a-notch/)
from Google Analytics won't come instantly, but when they do, they'll
come as many more [Adwords](https://adwords.google.com/select/)
subscribers, and by establishing the internet as the premier advertising
format.

There's so much more to Analytics than this - the 'Goal' idea is quite
interesting. You can assign dollar amounts to a page navigation sequence
- say, from an item page, to checkout, to a shipping confirmation page -
and then break down which segment of visitors is ordering the most
wigits or confirming their conference attendance.

There's even advanced regex filter support (for people who understand
what the hell that means =\] ). I can't say enough. If you have any sort
of website, from blog to e-commerce-mega-site, sign up for [Google
Analytics](http://google.com/analytics). It's flipping amazing.
