title: Statewide Severe Weather Drill
---
<p>...Governor Sonny Perdue has proclaimed the week of February 20-26, 2005 as Severe Weather Awareness Week in Georgia.  The annual Statewide Severe Weather Drill is scheduled for the morning of Wednesday, February 23.  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The National Weather Service will initiate the drill sometime prior to 12:00 noon on February 23.  When the drill is initiated, Athens-Clarke County will activate the severe weather sirens and the University of Georgia Police Department will activate the campus Emergency Broadcast System.  When you hear the activations, you should put your building severe weather emergency plan into action.</p>
<p>This couldn't have come at a better time. I have a 50 minute finance test at 10:10 tomorrow morning for which I haven't studied enough. Let's hope the sirens don't go off sometime within the 10:10 - 11:00 window - that would be a horrid, horrid shame.</p>
