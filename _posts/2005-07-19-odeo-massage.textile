While listening to podcasts on  "Odeo":http://odeo.com at work I stumbled across this error <del>massage</del> message:

<br />

<blockquote>Odeo's database servers are taking a quick break to get a massage.


We like to keep our databases happy, and to do so we make sure they get regular rejuvenation breaks. Odeo wants to keep it's databases happy and we understand that taking a break can't be run on a strict clock...Our databases will be happy to serve you as soon as they&nbsp;come back online.


Did you know that we've named all of servers after streets in the mission district of San Francisco?</blockquote>

Very rarely does an _error message_ make you feel _good_ about a website, but I like "Odeo":http://odeo.com better after seeing that error. It makes me feel all fuzzy inside, is built with "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com, *and* has "Science Friday's":http://www.sciencefriday.com/  podcast! :)
