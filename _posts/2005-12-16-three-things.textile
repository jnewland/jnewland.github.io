* "Gmail Mobile":http://m.gmail.com has convinced me to get my blackberry out again :).
* The Mac Mini that I'm setting up for my family this Christmas should be at my door in the next couple hours.
* *I JUST FINISHED MY LAST EXAM!!!* I'll be graduating from the University of Georgia tomorrow morning at 9:30am - and boy am I excited :).
