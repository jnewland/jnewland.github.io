This amazing post entitled "Being Poor":http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003704.html is required reading for anyone out there that still thinks that everyone that wanted to evacuate NO in the days before the storm was able to do so. I didn't think anyone can be that nieve, but apparently, I was wrong.

Come to think of it, that nievete is probably a good part of why the NO situation has gotten completely out of hand. I wonder if Mike Brown of FEMA has ever been poor.

Interesting news has come to light today regarding Mike Brown's history and how he got his current job:

bq.  _"The federal official in charge of the bungled New Orleans rescue was *fired from his last private-sector job* overseeing horse shows. [Brown] got [his current] job *through an old college friend* who at the time was heading up FEMA."_

This good-ole-boy-former-GOP-activist's poor planning and leadership have incredibly made this situation worse.  Shame on you, Mike. Hope you get fired from this job too, and soon.
