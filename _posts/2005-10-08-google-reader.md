Have a [Gmail](http://gmail.com) account yet? [Subscribe to my
blog](http://www.google.com/reader/preview/jesse+newland/feed/http://blog.jnewland.com/xml/rss/feed.xml)
in [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader),
[Google](http://google.com's) web-based feed reader, featuring all of
the speed (and keyboard shortcuts!!!) of Gmail.

I'm actually quite impressed with the speed of [Google
Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) considering that I'm on dailup
this weekend. My new favorite key is the '**j**' key - press it on your
[Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) and watch how quickly new
entries load in the whitespace. [Google](http://google.com's) slick AJAX
engine only requires that the next individual entry be loaded. No
headers. No footers. No banner ads or blogrolls. This is brilliant - the
exact same speed benefit that desktop feed readers get cooked into a web
based feed reader that doesn't even have to **think** about
*synchronization*. Add in labels (yep, just like
[Gmail](http://gmail.com)) and the search that we've come to expect from
[Google](http://google.com), and you have one excellent web app.

The only feature I'm missing so far - integration with
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us). I'm sure they'll add it soon. It's
still in beta, anyway ;-)
