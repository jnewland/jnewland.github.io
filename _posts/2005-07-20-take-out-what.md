[This](http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/18/congressman.muslims.ap/index.html)
is why having **old white men** in charge is a horrible idea. They say
**stupid things** and **embarass the whole country**. The spoekesperson
for Rep. Tancredo (FL) said he was "...speaking hypothetically..." when
he said the following on a radio show Friday:

<blockquote>
"Well, what if you said something like -- if this happens in the United
States, and we determine that it is the result of extremist,
fundamentalist Muslims, *you know, you could take out their holy
sites*," Tancredo answered.

"*You're talking about bombing Mecca*," Campbell said.

"*Yeah*," Tancredo responded.

</blockquote>
Incredible. I have nothing further to say.
