Wow. Ladies and Gentleman, there's a FIFTY NINE DEGREE difference between the temperatures of Athens and Bozeman today. 

If you need me, I'll be in the long underwear section of REI. Nothing like seeing that negative sign in a weather forecast to motivate you to buy warm clothes, I guess.

*{color:red}UPDATE*: coats have been secured. Fear the invisible man with his hand in his pocket --&rang;

Also picked up some gloves and some super warm polypropylene long underwear. Oh, and it's warmed up in Bozman: only -17 tonight.
