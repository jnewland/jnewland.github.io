<p>While the view isn't half bad, my life is pretty stressful right now. Summer classes require lots of work (two projects due Tuesday!), and while I'm not working on SQL or Java I'm getting ready for an upcoming <a href="http://www.teenmachinetour.com/event.htm">concert</a>, adjusting to a new job, and playing 4 frisbee games a week.</p>
