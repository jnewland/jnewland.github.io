<p>So I finished my resume today, phase one in the "make your web presence so hot you have to beat the job offers off with a stick" plan.</p>
<p>I think it's great. Check it out here:</p>

<p>In other news, I'm taking a <a href="http://wakh.net/interpersonalstudents.html" title="spcm 1500" rel="nofollow">maymester class</a>, so I'm overwhelmed with stuff to do. Three hours a day in class, and since we get no work done in class, a couple more hours reading and studying. Then work. I eat and sleep somewhere between that.</p>
<p>It sucks being this busy and this broke. So, HIRE ME SOMEONE! Please?</p>
