"This slideshow":http://www.kodakgallery.com/Slideshow.jsp?mode=fromshare&Uc=14ewb3ap.b147fdut&Uy=nyvoby&Ux=1 (via "AWholeLottaNothing":http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/09/incredible.html, via "MeFi":http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/44966) is absolutely amazing: a 1st person account of riding out the storm in New Orleans. Matt describes better than anyone else what these pictures capture:

bq. _"...calm followed by surprise and confusion and later untold devistation."_

As someone who's only visited NOLA once, this really put it in perspective. Jackson Square, Pat O'Brian's, The Hyatt, The Superdome, Canal Street: all of the major landmarks photographed by a _regular guy_ that ends up stealing a car to flee to Houston. What a story...
