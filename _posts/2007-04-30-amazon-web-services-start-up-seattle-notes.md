title: "Amazon Web Services: Start-Up Seattle Notes"
---
![](http://aws.typepad.com/aws_logo.gif) Last Thursday's [Start-Up
Seattle](http://aws.amazon.com/startupseattle) event put on by the
[Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) Team and [Medrona Venture
Group](http://www.madrona.com/) was an enlightening look at the endless
possibilities Amazons Web Services present to small companies. Even
though I'm fairly familiar with the inner workings of Amazons Web
Services - this blog is hosted on an
<abbr title="Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr> instance, and I recently
released [Capazon](http://capazon.rubyforge.org/), a
[Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/) extension library to manage
<abbr title="Elastic Compute Cloud">EC2</abbr> instances - this event
shed new light on how much they mean to the internet.

[Jeff Barr](http://www.jeff-barr.com/), Amazons Web Services Evangelist,
revealed that in Amazon's research, engineers at small web-based
companies revealed that they spent only 30% of their time developing
features unique to their product. The other 70% was spent doing
"undifferentiated heavy lifting": buying and configuring hardware,
dealing with data centers, implementing load balancing solutions, and
dealing with growth issues. With these issues being handled by Amazons
Web Services, small companies are able to focus more of their time on
their product's unique features instead of repeating the work of others
throughout the world.

This, in effect, shifts downward the cost of starting a new company, or
cycling the improvement loop in an existing company. There's no hardware
to buy, no hard drives to swap, no data centers to visit - only time
spent on the core product itself.

Andy Jassey, Amazons Web Services Senior Vice President, revealed
something very interesting: Amazon is no longer offering these services
with excess capacity at Amazon's data centers, rather, they are actively
purchasing new hardware dedicated to Amazons Web Services. "We're going
to scale Amazons Web Services as big as users demand", he said in
response to a question pertaining to the capacity Amazon has to offer.

I also had a great chat with Matt Garman, Amazon Web Services Product
Manager, during the wine tasting after the event.

I emerged from this event with pages and pages of notes detailing how
[LexBlog](http://www.lexblog.com/) could use Amazon Web Services for
future product offerings, and even to replace a good bit of our current
hardware. Events like these are few and far between, and I consider
myself very lucky to have been able to attend.
