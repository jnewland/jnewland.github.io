Arrr mateys! It'll be off the plank for any of ye who should abandon the decree and not "talk like a pirate today":http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html! (via "BoingBoing":http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/18/international_talk_l.html)

*I've "translated my blog into Pirate Talk":http://adactio.com/extras/talklikeapirate/ for the day. Shiver me timbers!*
