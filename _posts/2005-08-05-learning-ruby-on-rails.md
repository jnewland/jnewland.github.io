title: Learning Ruby on Rails

I just responded to the third e-mail in a week from friends asking me
*"How do I learn Ruby on Rails?"* I've amassed a good collection of
resources that are invaluable to anyone wanting to get on the proverbial
train, and I figured it was wrong not to share it with everyone......so,
here's your ticket:

*NOTE: All of the following links assume some programming knowledge. If
you're new to that too, check out [Learn To
Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/), a wonderful intro to
programming with Ruby*

-   First things first, [download
    rails](http://download.rubyonrails.com/)

<!-- -->

-   Step two, [buy the
    book](http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html). I
    bought the PDF, and have gone through two home-printed copies while
    I'm waiting for the final verision to ship (should get here
    very soon!). The Depot example application will help you understand
    the underlying structure of Rails.

<!-- -->

-   If you're new to Ruby as well, check out the
    [pickaxe](http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/pickaxe/), a great free
    Ruby book.

<!-- -->

-   Check out the [Ruby on Rails Wiki](http://wiki.rubyonrails.com) for
    tons of HowTo guides and community
    documentation. The search feature is helpful.

<!-- -->

-   The [API reference](http://api.rubyonrails.com) is the epitome of
    technical, but it sure is COMPREHENSIVE. Want to know if
    <code>ActiveRecord::Base\#\#Find</code> returns an
    <code>Array</code> or a <code>Hash</code>? This is the place to go.

<!-- -->

-   [Snippets tagged as
    rails](http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/tag/rails) - Random rails
    code
    written by random people showcased on a website that was written on
    rails in less than 2 days. Lots of great code to steal, or use as
    inspiration.

<!-- -->

-   Check out the [source
    code](http://www.typosphere.org/trac/browser/trunk) of
    [typo](http://www.typosphere.org) the weblog engine I'm using on [my
    blog](http://jnewland.com). This is an excellent application, as
    well as excellent code to use for
    inspiration.

<!-- -->

-   Better yet, get a [Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com) hosting
    account and setup a Typo blog for yourself! Textdrive is the best
    webhost for Ruby on Rails.
    Seriously, \$12 a month is cheap, and the support is great.

<!-- -->

-   \#rubyonrails on irc.freenode.net is a great place to real people
    about Rails. Have a question that's been bugging you? Ask one of
    the developers.

<!-- -->

-   Sign up for the Rails [mailing
    list](http://lists.rubyonrails.org/mailman/listinfo/rails). It's
    high traffic, but very good, and people share code on
    there frequently.

<!-- -->

-   Finally, immerse yourself in Rails. Read the [links tagged as rails
    at del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/tag/rails), read the [Ruby on
    Rails Weblog](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/), and check out the
    [lead developer's blog](http://www.loudthinking.com/). The Rails
    (and web development) community is rapidly changing, and it's to
    your advantage to stay on top of it.

That should keep anyone who's interested in Ruby on Rails occupied for
at least, oh, say, a couple months.

*NOTE: If you feel that any links should be added to or removed from
this list, post a message in the comments.*
