Have a "Gmail":http://gmail.com account yet? "Subscribe to my blog":http://www.google.com/reader/preview/jesse+newland/feed/http://blog.jnewland.com/xml/rss/feed.xml in "Google Reader":http://www.google.com/reader, "Google":http://google.com's web-based feed reader, featuring all of the speed (and keyboard shortcuts!!!) of Gmail. 

I'm actually quite impressed with the speed of "Google Reader":http://www.google.com/reader considering that I'm on dailup this weekend. My new favorite key is the '*j*' key - press it on your "Google Reader":http://www.google.com/reader and watch how quickly new entries load in the whitespace. "Google":http://google.com's slick AJAX engine only requires that the next individual entry be loaded. No headers. No footers. No banner ads or blogrolls. This is brilliant - the exact same speed benefit that desktop feed readers get cooked into a web based feed reader that doesn't even have to *think* about _synchronization_. Add in labels (yep, just like "Gmail":http://gmail.com) and the search that we've come to expect from "Google":http://google.com, and you have one excellent web app.

The only feature I'm missing so far - integration with "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us. I'm sure they'll add it soon. It's still in beta, anyway ;-)
