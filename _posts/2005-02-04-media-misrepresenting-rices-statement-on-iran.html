title: media misrepresenting Rice's statement on iran
---
<p>After Condoleezza Rice's statement this morning on Iran, the headlines across the US and Europe read like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20050204-0616-rice.html">Attack on Iran 'not on agenda,' Rice says</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6911810/">Rice: No attack on Iran</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/16372193?source=TiL&amp;ct=5">Rice denies Iran threat</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What Rice actually said, though, is much more interesting than what the media is telling you. When asked if a military attack against Iran was possible, Rice replied:</p>
<blockquote>"The question is simply not on the agenda at this point."</blockquote>
<p>Which, in newspeak, can mean many things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"The question"</em> is not on the agenda anymore, since it's already been answered.</li>
<li>The attack, which was previously on "the agenda," was removed from said "agenda" temporarily so Rice could make this statement truthfully.</li>
<li>It's a blatant lie (Rice has told a few of those before...<a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh041204.shtml">UNDER OATH</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we attack Iran, I'm moving out of the US. You heard it here first...</p>
