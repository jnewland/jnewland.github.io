title: del.icio.us Javascript Link Blog
---
"del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us is by far my favorite web app of recent times. _(For those who aren't inter-web-a-holics, del.icio.us is a social bookmarks manager.)_ I have "tons":http://del.icio.us/jbnewland of bookmarks there, and read the "popular links":http://del.icio.us/popular page religiously.

Anyway, a feature I've been waiting forever for was announced on the _delicious-discuss_ mailing list just a second ago: javascript link blog includes! 

To setup a link blog, click "here":http://del.icio.us/doc/feeds/js/, customize the options, then copy the javascript into your blog template. Style to taste, and you can have something just like the link blog I've setup on my sidebar.

If you're already a del.icio.us user, make sure to check out "my bookmarks":http://del.icio.us/jbnewland, I post like a madman. If you don't have a del.icio.us account already, I really suggest you "register":http://del.icio.us/register today. Here's a nice "beginner's guide":http://www.beelerspace.com/index.php?p=890, if you need such a thing.
