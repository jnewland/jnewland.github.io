Soylentfoo and
[Tweet](http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/22/tweet-update-twitter-via-quicksilver),
a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) action for
[Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) that I made some
updates to, were shown for around 15 milliseconds in today's episode of
[Rocketboom](http://www.rocketboom.com/). This is both nothing and
everything at the same time. [Watch it
here](http://www.rocketboom.com/stories/rb_07_mar_20).

In other meta-news, earlier this morning I moved Soylentfoo from my
[Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) Mixed Grill account to a [Amazon
EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) server
(`domu-12-31-34-00-02-4e.usma2.compute.amazonaws.com`, to be exact). For
those thinking of using EC2 as a Ruby on Rails host in the future, stay
tuned for a release of
[Capazon](http://rubyforge.org/projects/capazon/), a
[Capistrano](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tools/capistrano)
rubygem plugin that aims to make deployment of a Rails application to an
Amazon EC2 instance a ridiculously simple process. I'm getting very very
close to a release.
