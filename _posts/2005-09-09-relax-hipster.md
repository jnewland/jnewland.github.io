bq. ***Sep 9, 2005 12:45 AM** - Arrived at FedEx location -
INDIANAPOLIS, IN*

Maybe, just *maybe* it'll get here tomorrow?

**What** will get here tomorrow you ask? Why, that would be my new
`(15" / 1.67GHZ) `**Apple Powerbook G4**!!!! An exciting new job needs
to be rewarded, I decided. Yes, I am now drinking the
[KoolAid](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/iProduct.gif).

I've been checking *Order Status* and *Shipment Tracking* webpages like
it's my job for the past couple of days. I absolutely can't wait.

Aw who am I kidding, the Powerbook probably won't be here until Monday.
But hey, I can dream, right?
