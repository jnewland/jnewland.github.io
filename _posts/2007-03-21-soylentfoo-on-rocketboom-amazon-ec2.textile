Soylentfoo and "Tweet":http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/articles/2007/01/22/tweet-update-twitter-via-quicksilver, a "Twitter":http://www.twitter.com action for "Quicksilver":http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/ that I made some updates to, were shown for around 15 milliseconds in today's episode of "Rocketboom":http://www.rocketboom.com/. This is both nothing and everything at the same time. "Watch it here":http://www.rocketboom.com/stories/rb_07_mar_20.

In other meta-news, earlier this morning I moved Soylentfoo from my "Textdrive":http://www.textdrive.com/ Mixed Grill account to a "Amazon EC2":http://aws.amazon.com/ec2 server (@domu-12-31-34-00-02-4e.usma2.compute.amazonaws.com@, to be exact). For those thinking of using EC2 as a Ruby on Rails host in the future, stay tuned for a release of "Capazon":http://rubyforge.org/projects/capazon/, a "Capistrano":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/tools/capistrano rubygem plugin that aims to make deployment of a Rails application to an Amazon EC2 instance a ridiculously simple process. I'm getting very very close to a release.
