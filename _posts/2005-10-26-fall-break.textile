I'm taking a much needed long weekend in Bozeman, Montana to visit my girlfriend. I'll be spending most of the day tomorrow in airports (yay) so, to pass the time, I'll be taking a bunch of pictures with my new phone and sending them to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jnewland">my flickr account</a>. So, take a look at my pictures tagged <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jnewland/tags/moblog">moblog</a> sometime tomorrow, there's sure to be something interesting. :)
