[Josh Peek](http://github.com/josh) committed a new feature to Edge
Rails today: [Rails
Metal](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8c3a54366435eebc2c8aa63b63e1349ce74a7b38).
After
[the](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ed708307137c811d14e5fd2cb4ea550add381a82)
[recent](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9c9da6c892d715ca22c3cf51f50deb1d80029c66)
[work](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/926844e869b747fa1e9474fd95f9b97fa04ae092)
to replace Rails' crufty request processing code with
[Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) and integrate its [middleware
support](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/06ed8e451198b2296d8b2752741e259b4f995081),
Rails Metal is a logical progression that allows Rails apps to use the
power of Rack middleware to create super-fast actions.

For example, here's a sample "Hello World" Metal:

{% highlight ruby %}\
class Poller &lt; Rails::Rack::Metal\
def call(env)\
if env\["PATH\_INFO"\] =\~ /\^\\/poller/\
\[200, {"Content-Type" =&gt; "text/html"}, "Hello, World!"\]\
else\
\[404, {"Content-Type" =&gt; "text/html"}, "Not Found"\]\
end\
end\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

And for comparison, a "Hello World" controller:

{% highlight ruby %}\
class OldPollerController &lt; ApplicationController\
def poller\
render :text =&gt; "Hello World!"\
end\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

So, let's fire up `ruby script/server` and see what this gives us:

{% highlight text %}\
\# traditional Controller\
\$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/old\_poller/poller\
Hello World!

\# the new Metal\
\$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/poller\
Hello World!\
{% endhighlight %}

So, the point of all of these other "micro-frameworks" is that they're
faster than Rails, right? Let's benchmark this new "Hello World" Metal:

{% highlight text %}\
\# first, let's benchmark the traditional controller\
\$ ab -n 1000 http://127.0.0.1:3000/old\_poller/poller\
... snip ...\
Requests per second: 408.45 \[\#/sec\] (mean)\
Time per request: 2.448 \[ms\] (mean)

\# now for the Metal middleware\
\$ ab -n 1000 http://127.0.0.1:3000/poller\
... snip ...\
Requests per second: 1154.66 \[\#/sec\] (mean)\
Time per request: 0.866 \[ms\] (mean)\
{% endhighlight %}

For this trivial "Hello World" benchmark, Rails Metal is 2.8x faster
than a Controller. Awesome. Have a couple actions of your app you need
to optimize? Instead of breaking them out into a separate application
using a micro-framework, add a Metal inside your existing app. You get
the performance benefits of processing requests outside of ActionPack,
and it's all integrated as a part of your Rails app. Easy!

### Sinatra Metal

You can [now](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/61a41154f) also use
Sinatra to create Metal end points:

{% highlight ruby %}\
Sinatra::Application.default\_options.merge!(:run =&gt; false, :env
=&gt;\
:production)\
Api = Sinatra.application unless defined? Api

get '/interesting/new/ideas' do\
'Hello Sinatra!'\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

First person to show the use of a Merb app as a Metal end point wins a
prize.

### Standalone Execution

Additionaly, Rails Metal are able to be executed in a separate process
from your Rails application using `rackup`:

{% highlight text %}\
rackup -s mongrel app/metal/poller.rb\
{% endhighlight %}

This runs the Poller Metal separeately from Rails, on it's own port
(`rackup` defaults to `9292`). This is perfect if you have an action
that's taking a very long time (for example a file upload) that you'd
like to split out from the normal Rails request processing queue.

### Testing Metal

**Update**: After several people commented asking how to test metal, DHH
chimed in and recommend Integration Testing for Metal end points, as
they hit the whole stack, and I submitted a patch cleaning up the
Integration Testing behavior of Metal. Testing Metal end points now
works just like any other Integration test:

{% highlight ruby %}\
class PollerTest &lt; ActionController::IntegrationTest\
test "poller returns hello world" do\
get "/poller"\
assert\_response 200\
assert\_response :success\
assert\_response :ok\
assert\_equal "Hello World!", response.body\
end\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

### Fun With Middleware

So, essentially, Rails Metal is a thin wrapper around Rails' new Rack
middleware support. Rack middleware is pretty powerful stuff:
framework-independent components that process requests independently or
in concert with other middleware. For example, here's a simple piece of
Rack middleware that runs a regex on responses:

{% highlight ruby %}\
class RegexMiddleware\
def initialize(app)\
@app = app\
end

def call(env)\
status, headers, response = @app.call(env)\
new\_response = \[\]\
response.each do |part|\
new\_response &lt;&lt; part.gsub(/World/, 'Middleware')\
end\
\[status, headers, new\_response\]\
end\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

To use this rack middleware in Rails, add this line to your
`environment.rb`

{% highlight ruby %}\
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|\
...\
config.middleware.use RegexMiddleware\
end\
{% endhighlight %}

Restart your server, and check out what happens:

{% highlight text %}\
\$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/poller\
Hello Middleware!\
{% endhighlight %}

The Rack middleware filtered the output of the Metal we created before.
This works with output generated by normal controllers and everything
too. The possible uses of this pattern are endless:

-   Single Sign On
-   Request/Response Signing (think [OAuth](http://oauth.net))
-   Asset Compression

[rack-contrib](http://github.com/rtomayko/rack-contrib/tree/master) is a
nice collection of Rack middleware if you're interested in more
examples.

Rails Metal is a simple wrapper around the existing (yet undocumented)
Rack middleware support in Edge Rails that attempts to DRY the process
of using middleware to create endpoints (like a poller) as opposed to
filters (which are better implemented as traditional middleware, like
the examples above). For example, Rails Metal might be used:

-   To speed up a 'poller' action called by all active users of a
    popular web-based chat application every 3 seconds (hint: Campfire).
-   To improve the performance of any API endpoint
-   To process file uploads outside of the Rails request queue
-   To authorize delivery of cached content

### We don't need no stinking micro-frameworks

With the additional of Metal and Rack middleware support, Rails
effectively includes a micro-framework of its own; one that either
tighly integrates with Rails or is executed separately - whichever the
need dictates.

This is a great response by the Rails team to all of the buzz surrouding
micro-frameworks: a micro-framework with the power of Rails. I'm
definitely going to try this approach to squeeze a couple extra requests
per second out of a heavily trafficked API call - let me know in the
comments if you find a use for it.

Read up a bit more on [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) and then take a
look at Josh's commit [Introducing Rails
Metal](http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8c3a54366435eebc2c8aa63b63e1349ce74a7b38)
(and the ensuing comments) if you're interested for more information.
