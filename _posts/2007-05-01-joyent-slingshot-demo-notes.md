title: Joyent Slingshot Demo Notes\
---\
[Eric Wagoner](http://www.ericwagoner.com/weblog/) gave a demo of the
[Joyent's](http://joyent.com/newly) newly released offline Rails
application toolkit, [Slinghot](http://developers.joyent.com/). He's had
access to Slingshot for a couple weeks ahead of the public release, and
shared his early impressions with us tonight. These are rough notes from
his presentation.

-   A local Slingshot app is distributed as a DMG on OS X, which is a
    full-stack Ruby VM plus your Rails apps. Lots of files. I mean,
    lots.: `$ find Radiant.app | wc -l -> 8087`
-   Server side, Slingshot uses a plugin that generates a
    'sync' controller. This controller has several actions:
    -   sync.up
    -   sync.down
    -   sync.log
-   These toss XML back and forth between the server and client app,
    containing the changed Models and some metadata.
-   **Synchronization conflicts are handled in your
    application's domain.** This is important to note - Slingshot is not
    a silver bullet for the age old offline/online
    synchronization problem. However, it lets you solve this problem
    however your application needs.
