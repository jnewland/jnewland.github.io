title: random subway searches?
---
*Ben Franklin:*
bq. _"Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."_

The liberty/security scale has just been tipped by the 1000 gorilla that is the NYPD. There will be random searches of subway passenger's bags starting friday.

"In New Security Move, New York Police to Search Commuters' Bags":http://nytimes.com/2005/07/21/nyregion/21cnd-security.html?ei=5090&en=3c839066ea31fd8b&ex=1279598400&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all - from the NYTimes.

What does Mayor Bloomberg have to say about all of this?

bq. _"We live in a world where sadly these types of security measures are necessary. Are they intrusive? Yes, a little bit. But we're trying to find the right balance."_

Mr. Mayor, please take a lesson from Dr. Franklin. This is rediculous.
