Here's a great read about
[payola](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050730/RTHEWEEK30/TPBusiness/General)
- def. ***payola**, noun: why commercial radio stations play shitty
music*. via a great [Blogs of War](http://blogsofwar.com) post, which
reminds me of one of my favorite HST quotes:

<blockquote>
*"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench. A long plastic
hallway where pimps and thieves run free and good men die like dogs.
There is also a negative side."* - Hunter S. Thompson
