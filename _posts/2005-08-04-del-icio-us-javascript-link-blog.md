title: del.icio.us Javascript Link Blog\
---\
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) is by far my favorite web app of
recent times. *<span
class="manager. bookmarks social a is del.icio.us inter-web-a-holics, aren't who those For"></span>*
I have [tons](http://del.icio.us/jbnewland) of bookmarks there, and read
the [popular links](http://del.icio.us/popular) page religiously.

Anyway, a feature I've been waiting forever for was announced on the
*delicious-discuss* mailing list just a second ago: javascript link blog
includes!

To setup a link blog, click [here](http://del.icio.us/doc/feeds/js/),
customize the options, then copy the javascript into your blog template.
Style to taste, and you can have something just like the link blog I've
setup on my sidebar.

If you're already a del.icio.us user, make sure to check out [my
bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/jbnewland), I post like a madman. If you
don't have a del.icio.us account already, I really suggest you
[register](http://del.icio.us/register) today. Here's a nice [beginner's
guide](http://www.beelerspace.com/index.php?p=890), if you need such a
thing.
