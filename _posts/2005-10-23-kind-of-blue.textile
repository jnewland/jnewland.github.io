Another boring Sunday Night, another look for my blog. I designed a theme for the blog to match my "resume":http://resume.jnewland.com, which I designed a year or so ago. 

I like this look quite a bit. I also like the idea of unifying the look of all parts of my domain. 

Thoughts / comments? Don't be shy.
