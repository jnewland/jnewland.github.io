Another boring Sunday Night, another look for my blog. I designed a
theme for the blog to match my [resume](http://resume.jnewland.com),
which I designed a year or so ago.

I like this look quite a bit. I also like the idea of unifying the look
of all parts of my domain.

Thoughts / comments? Don't be shy.
