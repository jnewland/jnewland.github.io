Go add "twittersearch":http://twitter.com/twittersearch as a follower, wait one minute, then send a direct message to twittersearch with a search query ("d twittersearch foo"). You should get a direct message back within a minute from "Dave Troy's":http://twitter.com/davetroy wonderful "Twitter Search":http://twittermap.com/search hack with the last public update matching your search query.

Why? Because I can. 173 lines of Ruby glue code. Are you ready for Twitter "web services":http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/27/twitter-becomes-mobile-dev-platform/? This is the start of something very interesting.

*UPDATE*: Of course, right when I launch this thing, Twitter vanishes from the internets. My guess: the tubes are full.
