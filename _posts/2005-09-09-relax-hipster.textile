bq. _*Sep 9, 2005  12:45 AM * - Arrived at FedEx location - INDIANAPOLIS, IN _

Maybe, just _maybe_ it'll get here tomorrow? 

*What* will get here tomorrow you ask? Why, that would be my new @(15" / 1.67GHZ) @*Apple Powerbook G4*!!!! An exciting new job needs to be rewarded, I decided. Yes, I am now drinking the "KoolAid":http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/iProduct.gif.

I've been checking _Order Status_ and _Shipment Tracking_ webpages like it's my job for the past couple of days. I absolutely can't wait.

Aw who am I kidding, the Powerbook probably won't be here until Monday. But hey, I can dream, right?

Wooo hoo!!! :-D
