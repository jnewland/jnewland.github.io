Scott Adams' (of "Dilbert":http://www.dilbert.com fame) has just released his book, _God's Debris_, "free":http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/godsdebris/ as a "PDF":http://images.ucomics.com/images/pdfs/sadams/godsdebris.pdf. Why? Scott has this to say:

bq. "Frankly, this is the hardest book in the world to market. When it first came out in hardcover, booksellers couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t decide if it was fiction or nonfiction. Was it philosophy or religion? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a religion/science book written by a cartoonist, using hypnosis techniques in the writing. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a thought experiment. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unlike anything youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever read. How do you sell something that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be explained?"

bq. ...

bq. "ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s designed to be discussed with people who have also read it." 

Brilliant. In a society obsessed with copyright, ownership, and property, it's nice to see someone who's not scared to give something away. The biggest problem in the book publishing industry right now is dwindling readership - Cheers to Scott for not approaching this problem like the RIAA/MPAA and blaming his customers for the book's low numbers. He saw the problems with marketing this book in the traditional way, so instead decided to give this one away in hopes that the discussion it spawns will cause others to either buy it or read it themselves, and then move onto the sequel. I'm liking this approach.

I just downloaded the "PDF":http://images.ucomics.com/images/pdfs/sadams/godsdebris.pdf of _God's Debris_ and browsed through the introduction. Adams' intended target audience for this book, he says, are "people who 
enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls." I think I found my plans for the weekend. :)
