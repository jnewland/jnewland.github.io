title: xml feeds moved to feedburner
---
<p>I just moved all of the rss/xml feeds on this site over to the amazingly cool <a href="http://feedburner.com" title="feedburner">feedburner</a> service. Check it out if you have an xml feed on your blog or website.</p>
<p>One of the best things feedburner does is make an XML file readable when a user simply clicks on it in his or her browser. Try it out: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/jnewlandcom" title="xml feed powered by feedburner"><img src="http://jnewland.com/images/xml.gif" /></a></p>
<p><em>oh, btw, the old feeds don't work anymore. whoops.</em></p>
