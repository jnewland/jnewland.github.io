<div id="what_is_this" class="hidden"><p>This is the personal weblog/web-design sandbox of Jesse Newland. I am constantly tweaking the design, posting links from sites I read, and writing articles about the web, technology, politics, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jager_Bomb" title="wikipedea: Jager Bomb">Jager Bombs</a>.</p></div>

<div id="what_is_here" class="hidden"><p>The "In The News" block to your left is a auto-updating list of links that I found interesting. I post these rather regularly: from one to ten a day. Basically, read these if you want to be able to strike up an interesting conversation with me.</p>
<p>The posts below are irregular rants about whatever is on my mind.</p>
