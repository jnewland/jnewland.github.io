title: Woot Twitter-bot Now Official\
---\
There's been quite a bit of anti-[Twitter](http://twitter.com) backlash
recently, the most notable of which was a [Wall Street Journal
article](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117373145818634482-ZwdoPQ0PqPrcFMDHDZLz_P6osnI_20080315.html)
ironically published on one of [Twitter's busiest
days](http://waxy.org/archive/2007/03/15/tracking.shtml) during SXSW. My
friend Ryan is quoted in the article:

> "I probably started removing people the first week," said [Ryan
> Irelan](http://www.ryanirelan.net), 31, a Web developer in Raleigh,
> N.C., who [began using Twitter](http://twitter.com/ryanirelan) last
> year. "This constant dinging of updates," he added, "it really just
> became totally overwhelming. I don't see how anyone could get anything
> done."

While there's truth to what Ryan said about Twitter's potential to be
addictive and overwhelming, there's no doubt that Twitter is [going
places](http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/movers_shakers?lang=en).

Earlier today, the folks at [Woot](http://www.woot.com/)
[announced](http://www.woot.com/Blog/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryId=2147)
their [Woot Twitter-bot](http://twitter.com/woot) and solved a
long-standing problem of theirs - how to quickly notify their rabid fan
base of their new product offerings. By using Twitter to publish this
data, it is therefore available via IM, SMS, or the web - whichever the
end user desires.

The [Woot Twitter-bot](http://twitter.com/woot) (go take a look, there's
a [Woot-Off](http://www.woot.com/WhatIsWoot.aspx#q9) going on right
now!) happens to be my brain-child (I set it up during the last Woot-Off
after being unsatisfied with other ways of being instantly notified of
new deals), and was recently contacted by Dave Rutledge at Woot, and
agreed to allow them to make it official.

The folks at Twitter noticed Woot's new offering, and had [this
comment](http://twitter.com/blog/2007/03/drops.html):

> As far as we know, Woot is the first to use Twitter like this; as a
> way to let people keep on top of what's being sold. Very cool.

The folks at Twitter are sure to like this, because it fits into a [very
possible monetizing
strategy](http://www.mdoeff.com/blog/2007/03/21/the-future-of-twitter/)
for Twitter: corporate-sponsored Twitter accounts providing updates on
flight times, shelling out coupon codes, or promoting TV shows.

For others interested in creating Twitter-bots of their own, I've
released [the source](http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3714) I used
to initially create the Woot Twitter-bot. Feel free to
[download](http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/3714) it and do what you
please.
