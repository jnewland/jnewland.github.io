In support of [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org/) and [CSS
Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/), the stylesheets on
[Soylentfoo](http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/) and my
[resume](http://resume.jnewland.com/) have been disabled today, April
5th (Actually, I'm a couple hours early. So sue me).

I take great care in designing the XHTML of both of these sites, and
it's a pleasure to be able to show it off. View the source,
[validate](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fsoylentfoo.jnewland.com%2F)
it, then take a look at your site. [How does it look
naked?](http://simonwillison.net/2002/Sep/11/disableCSSBookmarklet/)

UPDATE: My good friend [Chris Martin](http://cjmart.in/) is celebrating
as well.
