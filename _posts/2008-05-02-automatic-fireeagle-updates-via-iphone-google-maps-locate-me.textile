title: Automatic FireEagle updates via iPhone Google Maps 'Locate Me'
---
The following instructions will setup your Jailbroken iPhone to update your "FireEagle":http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/
location every 5 minutes. While "Navizon provides this same feature":http://theregoesdave.com/2008/03/21/navizon-enables-fire-eagle-location-updates/, I've been "less than impressed with it's accuracy":http://twitter.com/jnewland/statuses/774922587 . This method uses both "Skyhook":http://www.skyhookwireless.com/ and the Google Maps 'Locate Me' cell-tower-triangulation method, which are much more accurate than Navizon in my recent tests.

h3. Prerequisites

* Jailbroken 1.1.x iPhone
* OpenSSH installed on iPhone
* A computer on the same subnet as your iPhone
* "FireEagle":http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/ invite
** If you don't have one, ask "@firebot":http://twitter.com/firebot nicely.

h3. Step 1: Disable Sleep

* Settings -> General -> Set Auto-Lock to 'Never'
** This is to ensure the SSH connection we'll establish in Step 3 isn't
  terminate. You may revert this setting after following these instructions.

h3. Step 2: Determine your iPhone's IP Address

 * Settings -> Wi-Fi
 ** Tap the blue arrow to the right of the wireless network with the check by it

h3. Step 3: SSH into your iPhone

Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and run the following:

{% highlight text %}
ssh root@YOUR_IPHONE_IP
{% endhighlight %}

Your password is 'alpine' unless you've changed it

h3. Step 4: Download needed files

{% highlight text %}
mkdir -p bin/fireeagle
cd bin/fireeagle
curl -O http://ericasadun.com/ftp/TUAW/findme/authcheck
curl -O http://ericasadun.com/ftp/TUAW/findme/authtoken
curl -O http://ericasadun.com/ftp/TUAW/findme/firefindme
curl -O http://ericasadun.com/ftp/TUAW/findme/pingwifi
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Step 5: Create wrapper script

{% highlight text %}
cat > /var/root/bin/fireeagle/firewrapper << EOF
date > /var/log/fire.log
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/pingwifi
/bin/sleep 7 
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/firefindme -g -d -F >> /var/log/fire.log
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/firefindme -k -d -F >> /var/log/fire.log
exit 0
EOF
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Step 6: Set executable bit on all files

{% highlight text %}
chmod a+x /var/root/bin/fireeagle/*
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Step 7: Authenticate with FireEagle

{% highlight text %}
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/authtoken
{% endhighlight %}

This will open a MobileSafari window. Login to your FireEagle account and allow TrackMe to update your location. Then run:

{% highlight text %}
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/authcheck
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Step 8: Test!

{% highlight text %}
/var/root/bin/fireeagle/firewrapper
{% endhighlight %}

After several seconds, you should be returned to a shell prompt. Now visit "FireEagle's My Location":http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/my/location page and login. You should see:

bq. Fire Eagle last spotted you less than a minute ago at LOCATION using TrackMe.

If not, please start over at Step 4. Something's gone wrong.

h3. Step 9: Steup LaunchDaemon to ping FireEagle every 5 minutes

{% highlight text %}
cat > /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fireeagle.ping.plist << EOF
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.fireeagle.ping</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/var/root/bin/fireeagle/firewrapper</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <false/>
    <key>StartInterval</key>
    <integer>300</integer>
  </dict>
</plist>
EOF
launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fireeagle.ping.plist
{% endhighlight %}

h3. You're Finished!

That should do it! Please let me know via twitter 
("@jnewland":http://twitter.com/jnewland) or in the comments if you have any problems / suggestions! Big thanks to "Erica Sadun":http://ericasadun.com/ for writing the iPhone tools used to make this happen!
