So I'm the lounge on the 3rd floor of Terminal A at Hartsfield-Jackson-Long-Named International Airport, sitting in the Budweiser lounge drinking a Killians and eating some nachos before I begin my trip to Bozeman, MT via Salt Lake City. :) I've never been so excited to go anywhere...this should be a great trip. I should be posting photos like crazy on flickr, so check back often!
