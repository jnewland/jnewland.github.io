title: Twitter Search Bot

Go add [twittersearch](http://twitter.com/twittersearch) as a follower,
wait one minute, then send a direct message to twittersearch with a
search query ("d twittersearch foo"). You should get a direct message
back within a minute from [Dave Troy's](http://twitter.com/davetroy)
wonderful [Twitter Search](http://twittermap.com/search) hack with the
last public update matching your search query.

Why? Because I can. 173 lines of Ruby glue code. Are you ready for
Twitter [web
services](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/27/twitter-becomes-mobile-dev-platform/?)
This is the start of something very interesting.

**UPDATE**: Of course, right when I launch this thing, Twitter vanishes
from the internets. My guess: the tubes are full.
