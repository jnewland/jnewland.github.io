title: It's Not Easy Being Green
---
To celebrate the "Typo Theme Contest":http://typogarden.com/, I'll be redesigning my blog numerous times this month. This edition will be called _Simple_, and will be tested here for a few days, submitted, and then be replaced by a new design.

Features of _Simple_:

* 100% less graphics
* Pleasant, %{color:green}green% headers.
* Clean, easy to read fonts (Georgia for the headers, Verdana for the body text)
* Only the most recent post is displayed, with links to most of the older ones below. I'm still kind of iffy about this. I may change it up so that only posts from the last week are displayed, instead of just one. Maybe I'll show snippets, ala Gmail. Who knows.
* A search in progress now displays text instead of that pesky blue spinner.

Anyway, if you have anything to say about this design, leave a comment! I'm open to suggestions.
