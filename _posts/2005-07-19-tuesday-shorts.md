-   Expect changes to this blog soon. [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com)
    (the [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyondails.com) powered blogging
    engine this site uses) is rapidly approaching a new release (check
    out how [busy](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/timeline) they are
    recently), and I'm getting ansty. I'm thinking of checking out the
    trunk of typo and using this blog as a testing ground for patches.
    Stay tuned...
-   [Rojo](http://rojo.com), my current web based RSS reader, just isn't
    cutting it for me. It's buggy, lacks XML feeds of any sort, and is
    too slow. Bloglines has always sucked. The perfect product just
    isn't there. Where is the [flickr](http://flickr.com) or
    [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) of RSS aggregators? Anyone?
