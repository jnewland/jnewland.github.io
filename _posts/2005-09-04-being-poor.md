This amazing post entitled [Being
Poor](http://www.scalzi.com/whatever/003704.html) is required reading
for anyone out there that still thinks that everyone that wanted to
evacuate NO in the days before the storm was able to do so. I didn't
think anyone can be that nieve, but apparently, I was wrong.

Come to think of it, that nievete is probably a good part of why the NO
situation has gotten completely out of hand. I wonder if Mike Brown of
FEMA has ever been poor.

Interesting news has come to light today regarding Mike Brown's history
and how he got his current job:

> *"The federal official in charge of the bungled New Orleans rescue was
> **fired from his last private-sector job** overseeing horse shows.
> \[Brown\] got \[his current\] job **through an old college friend**
> who at the time was heading up FEMA."*

This good-ole-boy-former-GOP-activist's poor planning and leadership
have incredibly made this situation worse. Shame on you, Mike. Hope you
get fired from this job too, and soon.
