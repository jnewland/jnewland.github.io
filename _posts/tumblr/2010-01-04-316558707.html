title: "Where's the bloat: Tracking 'require' memory usage in Ruby and Rails"
---

<p>Among the other&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2009/04/09/ruby-gc-tuning/">awesome things</a> that&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyenterpriseedition.com/">Ruby Enterprise Edition</a>&#8217;s inclusion of&nbsp;the <a href="http://railsbench.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/railsbench/GCPATCH">RailsBench GC patch</a> provides is the addition of the <code>allocated_size</code> method on Ruby&#8217;s&nbsp;<code>GC</code> constant.</p>







<p><a href="http://twitter.com/lindvall">Eric Lindvall</a> recently <a href="http://bitmonkey.net/post/308322913/tracking-initial-memory-usage-by-file-in-ruby">devised a very clever use</a> for this <code>GC.allocated_size</code> method:</p>







<blockquote>

<p>If I wanted to see what was contributing to the large memory footprint of an application on startup, tracking how much memory was allocated during each <code>require</code> would give me a good place to start.</p>

</blockquote>







<p>Given the size of <code>GC.allocated_size</code> before and after require calls, we can determine the initial memory profile of any ruby gem, library, file, or Rails model.</p>







<p>To use this to determine the initial memory profile of a beefy Rails application, you&#8217;ll first want to download his <a href="http://gist.github.com/264496">require_tracking hax</a>.&nbsp;Then, load your production Rails application&#8217;s environment with require_tracking turned on:</p>







<pre><code>

RAILS_ENV=production ruby -r/tmp/require_tracking.rb  -e "require 'config/environment'"

Memory used by file:

                                     File KB
