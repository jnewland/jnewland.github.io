title: moving day!
---
*11:20 am:* I'm laying on the floor of my new apartment bedroom (the big one, my "roomie":http://www.roundhere.net/blog/ is "out of town":http://flickr.com/photos/cjmartin).  The neighbors have wireless (!!!), so a big thanks goes out to them (whoever they are) for saving us some mad cash this fall.

Pictures are coming soon, I took some during the walkthrough w/ the landlord.

*1 pm:* Couple boxes brought upstairs, back to work.

*10:15 pm:* After a long evening of moving anything that I could fit in my Honda, I'm exhausted. I have a Java final tomorrow morning at 8 am: the class is a piece of cake, I'm just not excited about being up that early. It's been a while.

Well, I'm off to sleep - on a very carefully constructed pallet of my comforter and a sleeping bag. It looks very much like my bed the way it's set up right now, but I have a feeling it will be slightly less comfortable.

_PS - The programming portion of my Java test is open-book/notes/internet, so I might just do some exam-blogging tomorrow. Crazy!_
