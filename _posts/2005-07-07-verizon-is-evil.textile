title: verizon is evil
---
"This man":http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/verizon-is-evil-111492.php was so angered by Verizon's replacement policies he stood in front of the store holding a 'verizon is evil' sign. I've been that mad at verizon a couple times.

Does _anyone_ actually like Verizon? The only people I know (myself included) who are still with them are locked in by contract _(In my case, it's a family plan)_. 

Here's an old blog post I made about "my problems with verizon":http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:s26rAHzJir8J:jnewland.com/2004/06/verizon-wireless-sucks.html+jnewland.com+verizon&hl=en&start=1&client=firefox-a that I dug out of the Google Cache.
