-   [Gmail Mobile](http://m.gmail.com) has convinced me to get my
    blackberry out again :).
-   The Mac Mini that I'm setting up for my family this Christmas should
    be at my door in the next couple hours.
-   **I JUST FINISHED MY LAST EXAM!!!** I'll be graduating from the
    University of Georgia tomorrow morning at 9:30am - and boy am I
    excited :).
