Chief Justice William Rehnquist died last night, at the age of 80.

[From MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9194092/):

> *"The death leaves President Bush with his second court opening within
> four months and sets up whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s expected to be an even
> more bruising Senate confirmation battle than that of John Roberts."*

From the [Metafilter thread discussing this
issue](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/44806):

> *"This is a terrible movie and I want my money back. Even odds on a
> California earthquake within the week."* - posted by *Armitage Shanks*

It's sad to see Rehnquist go (I hope you're happy, [Justice
Sunday](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/44806#1033179)) in more ways than
one: this is really, really bad news for the Supreme Court. President
Bush receiving the priviledge of nominating another Supreme Court
Justice in the middle of both domestic and foreign quagmires for which
he is (directly or indirectly) responsible absolutely infuriates me.
