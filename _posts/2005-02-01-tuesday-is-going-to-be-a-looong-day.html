title: tuesday is going to be a looong day
---
<p>Tomorrow (or today, I should say) is going to be crazy. I caught myself just an hour or so ago making a to-do list that included making <strong><em>another</em></strong> to-do list of all the other stuff I have to do.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm done with <em>that</em> list, so I'm going to sleep. <a href="http://jnewland.tadalist.com/lists/public/16632" title="crazy tuesday" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the list - you can watch as I check off items throughout the day. If you have enough spare time to do that, I envy you. Or I would, at least, if I had enough time.</p>
