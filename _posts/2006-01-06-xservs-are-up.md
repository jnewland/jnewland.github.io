title: Xservs are up!
---
![](http://files.jnewland.com/server.png) Today,
[Lexblog](http://www.lexblog.com) took a big leap in the right
direction. Our current server setup has been causing us headaches in
recent months, so we decided to go with an in-house hosting solution.
Two shiny [Apple Xservs](http://www.apple.com/xserve/) were ordered,
shipped, and upgraded. Today, they were booted up for the first time,
and with the help of [Apple Remote
Desktop](http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/), I've been configuring,
updating, and generally massaging our new workhorses.

These servers don't know what's about to hit them: I've prepared a tasty
cocktail of Movable Type, [LightTPD](http://lighttpd.com), and
[FastCGI](http://fastcgi.com) to power our blogs, with a sprinkling of
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com) on the top to make management of
our blogs easier.

Watch out for some new features and upgrades from Lexblog in the next
few months, as well as drastic speed improvements. They don't call it
FastCGI for nothing ;)
