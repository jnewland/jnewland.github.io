---
<p>I <em>need</em> an iPod. So I gave in and signed up for one of those free iPod websites - and realized that it's a lot easier than I had thought. The offers on there are all very simple - the one I signed up for cost me $1 and I'll get a $20 circut city gift card in the mail in a week.</p>
<p>So, I guess what I'm saying is:</p>
