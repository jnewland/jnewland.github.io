title: It's Not Easy Being Green
---
To celebrate the [Typo Theme Contest](http://typogarden.com/), I'll be
redesigning my blog numerous times this month. This edition will be
called *Simple*, and will be tested here for a few days, submitted, and
then be replaced by a new design.

Features of *Simple*:

-   100% less graphics
-   Pleasant, <span style="color:green;">green</span> headers.
-   Clean, easy to read fonts (Georgia for the headers, Verdana for the
    body text)
-   Only the most recent post is displayed, with links to most of the
    older ones below. I'm still kind of iffy about this. I may change it
    up so that only posts from the last week are displayed, instead of
    just one. Maybe I'll show snippets, ala Gmail. Who knows.
-   A search in progress now displays text instead of that pesky
    blue spinner.

Anyway, if you have anything to say about this design, leave a comment!
I'm open to suggestions.
