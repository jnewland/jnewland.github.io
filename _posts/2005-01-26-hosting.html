<p>thanks to <a href="http://jasonlynes.com/" rel="co-worker friend met colleague" title="jason lynes">jason</a>,  this site finally has real hosting! as always, there are a couple kinks to work out after migrating the site:</p>
<ul class="redacted">
<li>my auto-generated blogroll doesn't work</li>
<li>a couple of my internal sites aren't working</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="redacted">this stuff should all be fixed by this evening.</span> <span class="update">UPDATE: everything works now!</span> enjoy the new, speedy site!</p>
