Scott Adams' (of [Dilbert](http://www.dilbert.com) fame) has just
released his book, *God's Debris*,
[free](http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/godsdebris/) as a
[PDF](http://images.ucomics.com/images/pdfs/sadams/godsdebris.pdf). Why?
Scott has this to say:

> "Frankly, this is the hardest book in the world to market. When it
> first came out in hardcover, booksellers couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t
> decide if it was fiction or nonfiction. Was it philosophy or religion?
> ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a religion/science book written by a cartoonist,
> using hypnosis techniques in the writing. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a
> thought experiment. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unlike anything
> youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever read. How do you sell something that
> canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be explained?"

> ...

> "ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s free because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s designed to
> be discussed with people who have also read it."

Brilliant. In a society obsessed with copyright, ownership, and
property, it's nice to see someone who's not scared to give something
away. The biggest problem in the book publishing industry right now is
dwindling readership - Cheers to Scott for not approaching this problem
like the RIAA/MPAA and blaming his customers for the book's low numbers.
He saw the problems with marketing this book in the traditional way, so
instead decided to give this one away in hopes that the discussion it
spawns will cause others to either buy it or read it themselves, and
then move onto the sequel. I'm liking this approach.

I just downloaded the
[PDF](http://images.ucomics.com/images/pdfs/sadams/godsdebris.pdf) of
*God's Debris* and browsed through the introduction. Adams' intended
target audience for this book, he says, are "people who\
enjoy having their brains spun around inside their skulls." I think I
found my plans for the weekend. :)
