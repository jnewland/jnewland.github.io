After all of the [hubub](http://www.techmeme.com/070721/p21#a070721p21)
this weekend about how [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/) is
['trouble'](http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/21/whyFeedburnerIsTrouble.html)
and ['bad for
us'](http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/22/feedburner-bad-for-us), I wanted
to make a quick note of a couple of ways to serve your feeds through
FeedBurner in a way that makes it possible to easily and seamlessly
bring your feeds back under your control at any time.

\# Use FeedBurner's
[MyBrand](http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/mybrand;jsessionid=90DFA112C8BFE3762618061519CF877F.fb1)
service (which is now
<a href="http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2007/07/freeburner_for_everyone.php">free</a>)
to serve your feeds using a domain you own. This lets you serve your
feeds with a URI of http://feeds.mysillyblog.com/mysillyfeed or the
like. In the event [Google 'preferring' Google Reader for feeds burned
by FeedBurner](http://www.centernetworks.com/google-prefers-google)
(something I'm confident Google will never do), you'd just point
feeds.mysillyblog.com back to a server you control, and in the blink of
a [TTL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live), your feeds are yours
again. For details on implementing MyBrand, check out Danny Sullivan's
great guide: [Stay Master of Your Feed
Domain](http://searchengineland.com/070110-111256.php).

\# Advertise your feed at a URL on your blog
(http://mysillyblog.com/index.xml), then redirect users to FeedBurner
with a [302
Found](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3)
redirect. Straight from the HTTP specifications, this tells your browser
or RSS reader:

<blockquote>
Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD
continue to use the Request-URI for future requests.

</blockquote>
Here's a nice guide detailing how to properly [redirect your feed to
FeedBurner](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200608/redirecting_feeds_to_feedburner/)
using a *302 Found* response code. In this case, if Google / FeedBurner
ever sins against you or your mother, your feeds can be instantly and
seamlessly moved away from FeedBurner by removing this redirect.

1.  For the extra paranoid, combine methods 1 and 2!

I'm a huge fan of FeedBurner, and like [Fred
Wilson](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/07/feedburner-and-.html), don't
share the concerns of Dave Winer about FeedBurner's future. At last
count, I manage around 225 feeds in several FeedBurner accounts, and
don't ever plan on going back. But, if the need arises, I take comfort
in knowing [how easy is is to
leave](http://blogs.feedburner.com/feedburner/archives/2005/06/ciao_feedburner.php).
To quote [Fred's
post](http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/07/feedburner-and-.html):

> That gives me all the comfort in the world. I love it when services
> make it easy to leave. When they do that, I tend to stay.
