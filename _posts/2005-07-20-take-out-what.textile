"This":http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/07/18/congressman.muslims.ap/index.html is why having *old white men* in charge is a horrible idea. They say *stupid things* and *embarass the whole country*. The spoekesperson for Rep. Tancredo (FL) said he was "...speaking hypothetically..." when he said the following on a radio show Friday:

<blockquote>"Well, what if you said something like -- if this happens in the United States, and we determine that it is the result of extremist, fundamentalist Muslims, _you know, you could take out their holy sites_," Tancredo answered.

"_You're talking about bombing Mecca_," Campbell said.

"_Yeah_," Tancredo responded.</blockquote>

Incredible. I have nothing further to say.
