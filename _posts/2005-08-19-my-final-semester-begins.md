title: My Final Semester Begins...
---
This past Thursday marked the first day of my final semster at the
[University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu) in Athens. After a couple of
days of strenuous syllabus sorting, things will [actually get
started](http://wiki.jnewland.com/uga/published) on Tuesday. (I do have
one class on Monday, but it's a breeze :\] ) Here are the classes I'm
getting ready for:

**Management Information Systems 4620 : *Systems Analysis and Design***

**** *Systems analysis and design with emphasis on the development of
business application systems. Methods of system documentation are
examined through the use of object-oriented and structured analysis
tools and techniques for describing processes, use cases, data
structures, system objects, file designs, input and output designs, and
program specifications.*

**** This seems like it will be a good bit of work. Eek.

**Management Information Systems 4630 : _ Network-Based Application
Development_**

**** *Network-based application development using a current development
language and platform. Concepts include application development
strategies and techniques, web technology platforms, a web development
language and web services. Projects will involve development of a
network-based application for an organization.*

**** Web apps built using JSP and Servlets basically. Boo Java.

**Management Information Systems 5640 : _ Network Management_**

**** *Basic computer networking technology concepts, standards,
products, services, security, and emerging technologies. This course
starts with basic networking, progressing to use of networking to
deliver and manage network applications / services. While the focus of
the course is around the Internet, the application of the concepts
extends to other networks.*

**** We have to write a web app that searches an existing web service
for this class. [flickr.rb](http://redgreenblu.com/flickr/) and [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) anyone? This should be fun.

**Management Information Systems 5990 : _ Directed Study_**

**** I convinced [Dr. Peircy](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~cpiercy/) to
sponsor me for a 3 hour directed study course. I'll be catching him up
on [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com) and helping him with some
of his web development projects.

**Economics 2100: *Economics of Environmental Quality***

**** *The economic analysis of environmental issues, with discussions of
current environmental quality problems, their underlying causes, and
command vs. market-based solutions.*

**** Sounds pretty interesting to me. For an ECON class, that is :)

For those still reading, I'm not done yet. I'm taking all of those
classes (**15 hours**) working **19 more hours** at Digital Insight,
actively developing **3 projects** in [Ruby on
Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com), and am anxiously awaiting news about
a new job. Sometimes, I really just don't know how I manage it all :).

Needless to say, I can't wait for all of this madness to end. It'll be
nice to be done with school, for one. But most of all, I just can't wait
to move out to Bozeman, MT to be with my beautiful girlfriend...
