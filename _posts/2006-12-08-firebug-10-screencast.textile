Just a couple days ago "Firebug":http://getfirebug.com 1.0 Beta was "released":http://www.getfirebug.com/blog/2006/12/04/firebug-10-news/, with loads and loads of new features. "Roger Johansson":http://www.456bereastreet.com/ calls it the "web developer tool of the year":http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/firebug_10_web_developer_tool_of_the_year/:

bq. With the recent release of Firebug 1.0 (beta - the old kind of beta, not a Web 2.0 eternal beta), this extension went from Ã¢â‚¬Å“greatÃ¢â‚¬Â to *absolutely marvelous*. A must have that no Web developer should do without. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m serious - you *need* Firebug.

I absolutely agree. In the short time since it's been released, I've used it to track down an obscure bug with Rails AJAX auto-completion helpers, debug the CSS on this blog, and inspect the AJAX behavior of "Campfire":http://campfire.com to add new features to Marshmallow, the unofficial ruby Campfire API (look for a gem release soon!).

So, this morning, I did a short screencast demoing some of my favorite features of "Firebug":http://getfirebug.com - some new in 1.0 Beta, and some there since the beginning. Here it is:

This is my first screencast, so go easy on me. :) Hope you enjoy!
