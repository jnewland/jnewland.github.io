Woah, I missed the addition of the @-c@ flag to the @./script/generate@ command. (When did this happen?) From the help:

<code><pre>-c, --svn    Modify files with subversion. (Note: svn must be in path)</pre></code>

Let's try it:

<code><pre>jnewland@slash trunk $ ./script/generate controller dashboard -c
      exists  app/controllers/
      exists  app/helpers/
      create  app/views/dashboard
A         app/views/dashboard
      exists  test/functional/
      create  app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb
A         app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb
      create  test/functional/dashboard_controller_test.rb
A         test/functional/dashboard_controller_test.rb
      create  app/helpers/dashboard_helper.rb
A         app/helpers/dashboard_helper.rb</pre></code>

Whoo! No more need to run @svn --force add .@ or anything else after generating a model, controller, or anything. There hasn't been a day in months where I haven't found out something like this in rails - a small touch that saves a big headache on my part. Nice work, guys :).
