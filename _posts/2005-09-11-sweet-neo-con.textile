<br />Thanks, Mick, this is awesome. Apparently, thankfully, wonderfully, The Stones don't think it's too late to change the world with music. They've got my support, and a bit of my hard earned money. I'm behind them 100% of the way, and hope you'll buy this album to say thanks.

The lyrics from _Sweet Neo Con_, from the *Rolling Stones*' new album, _A Bigger Bang_:
<blockquote><em>You ride around your white castle,<br />
    On your little white horse<br />
    You lie to your people,<br />
    and blame it on your war of course<br />
    You call yourself a Christian,<br />
    I call you a hypocrite<br />
    You call yourself a patriot,<br />
    well I think you're full of shit.<br />
<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    What path have you led them on?<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    Is it time for the atom bomb?<br />
    You parade around in costume,<br />
    Expecting to be believed<br />
    But as the body bags stack up,<br />
    We believe we've been deceived<br />
    The horror you've unleashed,<br />
    Will backfire with more grief<br />
    When will you ever learn,<br />
    Sweet Neo Con,<br />
    as the world burns?<br />
<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    What path have you led them on?<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    Is it time for the atom bomb?<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    What path have you led them on?<br />
    Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />
    Is it time to drop the bomb?<br />
    How come you're so wrong?<br />
    My sweet neo-con,<br />
    where's the money gone,<br />
    in the Pentagon.<br />
<br />
    It's liberty for all,<br />
    democracy's our style,<br />
    "*unless you are against us,<br />
    then it's prison without trial.*":http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/09/AR2005090901807.html
