title: Joyent Small 'Accelerators' Sluggish out of the Gate\
---\
I've been a long-time fan and supporter of
[Textdrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) Web Hosting - now a subsidiary of
[Joyent](http://www.joyent.com). They've done a great job over the years
of positioning themselves at the forefront of web hosting technology -
be it shared [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) hosting before
the masses, or their new
[Accelerator](http://radiant.joyent.com/accelerator/pricing/) Solaris
VPS offering. However, it seems as if Joyent's client services
department isn't in sync with their sharp tech arm.

When Joyent [announced their new low-end
Accelerators](http://joyeur.com/2007/03/06/accelerators-now-start-at-us45)
almost 3 weeks ago, I immediately recommended one to a friend. He signed
up right away. Several days later - March 9th - he still hadn't heard
anything from Joyent regarding his purchase past the initial
confirmation message, including this notice:

> You can expect to receive detailed information about access to your
> account shortly. In the interest of getting to know our clients right
> from the start, all accounts are lovingly created, in the traditional
> artisanal manner, by hand. Thus, the ETA for your login information
> can vary, depending on the current queue.

While this notice will be familiar to anyone who has ever used
Textdtive, what's not familiar is a delay of anything more than a day or
two. After my friend asked me if this was normal or not, I sent an email
to a contact at Joyent asking them for an ETA. The same day, my friend
(and, as I later discovered, all who ordered a small Accelerator) got
this message from Joyent support:

> Due to some unforeseen issues, we will be delivering your new small
> Accelerator **the week of March 19th**. You will not be charged for
> the system until we deliver you the login information to your system.
> We apologize for the delay, and know that we are working hard to
> ensure that your Accelerator system will be a top notch product when
> we deliver it to you.

The week of March 19th is dead and gone, and my friend hasn't heard a
peep from Joyent. The [buzz on Textdrive's
forums](http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=14914) shows that
we're not the only ones, and that the latest story a forum member heard
from Joyent staff is: *"...hardware delivery issues. They don't have an
ETA."*. This is downright unacceptable on several fronts:

1.  My friend didn't get a notice of the delay.
2.  Joyent apparently was selling access to hardware they didn't
    yet have.
3.  The [Accelerators' Pricing
    Page](http://radiant.joyent.com/accelerator/pricing/) still promises
    delivery of your order within 3 days.

So, my friend is left to do nothing but wait. In the meantime, however,
I have made note of another
[feature](http://joyeur.com/2007/03/22/joyent-slingshot) promised to
users of the Accelerators. While this is a revolutionary offering, who
knows if the whole damn kit and caboodle goes the way of
[Textpanel](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=textpanel+site%3Atextdrive.com&btnG=Search),
which was used to lure users in as early as [April
2005](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000444.html) and, despite being
[quitely killed](http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?id=14413) just
last month, is [still](http://textdrive.com/faqs/13) being hawked on
Textdrive's website. DUKE NUKEM FOREVER!

**UPDATE**: My friend just received this email from Joyent:

> We are experiencing unexpected hardware delivery delays on equipment
> required to deliver the small, \$45 per month accelerators. We are
> working with the supplier to expedite the equipment. Please know that
> we will deliver your accelerator as soon as possible and you will not
> be charged until we deliver the login credentials.

> We apologize for the inconvenience.

It looks as if Joyent started selling this plan without having the
equipment on hand. What a shame.
