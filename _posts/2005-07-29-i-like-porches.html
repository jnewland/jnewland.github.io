My days as a gypsy are going just fine: I've been staying at my friend The Rick's house since Wednesday night and really enjoying myself.<br />
<br />
Rick's front porch has a nice wicker table I've adopted as my desk for the time being. His house is in a quiet neighborhood, so I'm able to get lots of work done in my temporary outdoor office. I thought it'd be nice to share the view with everyone, so here you go :)
