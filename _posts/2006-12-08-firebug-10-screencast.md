Just a couple days ago [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com) 1.0 Beta was
[released](http://www.getfirebug.com/blog/2006/12/04/firebug-10-news/),
with loads and loads of new features. [Roger
Johansson](http://www.456bereastreet.com/) calls it the [web developer
tool of the
year](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/firebug_10_web_developer_tool_of_the_year/):

I absolutely agree. In the short time since it's been released, I've
used it to track down an obscure bug with Rails AJAX auto-completion
helpers, debug the CSS on this blog, and inspect the AJAX behavior of
[Campfire](http://campfire.com) to add new features to Marshmallow, the
unofficial ruby Campfire API (look for a gem release soon!).

So, this morning, I did a short screencast demoing some of my favorite
features of [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com) - some new in 1.0 Beta, and
some there since the beginning. Here it is:

This is my first screencast, so go easy on me. :) Hope you enjoy!
