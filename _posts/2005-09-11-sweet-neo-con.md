<br />Thanks, Mick, this is awesome. Apparently, thankfully,
wonderfully, The Stones don't think it's too late to change the world
with music. They've got my support, and a bit of my hard earned money.
I'm behind them 100% of the way, and hope you'll buy this album to say
thanks.

The lyrics from *Sweet Neo Con*, from the **Rolling Stones**' new album,
*A Bigger Bang*:

<blockquote>
<em>You ride around your white castle,<br />\
On your little white horse<br />\
You lie to your people,<br />\
and blame it on your war of course<br />\
You call yourself a Christian,<br />\
I call you a hypocrite<br />\
You call yourself a patriot,<br />\
well I think you're full of shit.<br />\
<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
What path have you led them on?<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
Is it time for the atom bomb?<br />\
You parade around in costume,<br />\
Expecting to be believed<br />\
But as the body bags stack up,<br />\
We believe we've been deceived<br />\
The horror you've unleashed,<br />\
Will backfire with more grief<br />\
When will you ever learn,<br />\
Sweet Neo Con,<br />\
as the world burns?<br />\
<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
What path have you led them on?<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
Is it time for the atom bomb?<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
What path have you led them on?<br />\
Oh, sweet Neo Con,<br />\
Is it time to drop the bomb?<br />\
How come you're so wrong?<br />\
My sweet neo-con,<br />\
where's the money gone,<br />\
in the Pentagon.<br />\
<br />\
It's liberty for all,<br />\
democracy's our style,<br />\
[\*unless you are against us,<br />\
then it's prison without
trial.\*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/09/AR2005090901807.html)\
