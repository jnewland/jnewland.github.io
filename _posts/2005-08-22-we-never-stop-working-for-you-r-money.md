title: We Never Stop Working For You(r Money)

For the second straight month I'm having to deal with a &gt; \$1,000
erroneous cell phone bill from Verizon. Last month the bill was
outrageous because somehow the concept that I needed to sign up for a
`National Access Data Plan` was left out of the conversation I had with
Customer Support, and I ended up getting charged by -the-minute for a
feature of my cell phone I wasn't even using.

We figured that one out after a couple hours on the phone with Customer
Support, and at the end of it, had arranged for them to:

-   Credit the bill for the overages
-   Sign me up for the `National Access Data` plan

This was all fine and dandy, but for some reason **we still had to pay
the taxes on the incorrect &gt; \$1000 charge**. This is pretty shady
business if you ask me.

So this month, the bill comes, and it appears as if **they incorrectly
setup the `National Access Data`**, and I'm still being charged by the
minute for Data use on my Blackberry!

What *really* is aggrivating though is that, right as I got off the
plane in Bozeman, MT last week, I called Verizon's friendly 611 Customer
Service to verify that I wouldn't incur **roaming** charges for Data
access. They **assured me that I the `National Access Data` plan that I
carried was just that (National) and that I would incur no fees above**
the roaming phone calls I made. The plan is even **listed** on the bill:

> @ Unlim. Blackberry, Mobile Web @ <br /> @ Monthly Charge: \$49.99 @
> <br /> @ Unit Allowance Unlimited kb @

There are charge for \$4.50 worth of roaming phone calls. But this is
dwarfed by the **7682 minutes** that I am somehow being charged for
using the Data part of my Blackberry.

There's no excuse for this. These guys are idiots, and it offends me to
hear them say *"We never stop working for you..."* a million times when
**I'm working to fix their problem**. It's obvious their customer base
is so huge they just *don't care* about the little guy.
