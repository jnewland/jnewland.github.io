<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/remydwd/37336479/">This picture</a> is a great example of the hilarious photos found in the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/stickfiguresinperil/pool/">Stick Figures in Peril Pool</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>. This group was featured on the flickr <a href="http://flickr.com/explore/">explore</a> page tonight, and I've been enjoying the photos and comments posted within. Some captions suggested in the comments on the shown photo:</p>
<ul>
<li>When working on your MC Hammer dance moves, watch out for machines that want to thwart you by stepping on your feet.</li>
<li>Please do not tickle the slide carousel. It will shin you.</li>
<li>Always exercise caution and use two hands when rockin' the electric organ.</li>
<li>LOL THE XBOX IS HUGE</li>
<li>Do not take bibles heavier than 100kg into the pulpit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this isn't funny to you, but I'm laughing so hard I'm almost crying right now!  Check out more <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/stickfiguresinperil/pool/">Stick Figures in Peril</a>, I promise you'll be amused.</p>
