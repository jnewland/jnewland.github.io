For the second straight month I'm having to deal with a > $1,000 erroneous cell phone bill from Verizon. Last month the bill was outrageous because somehow the concept that I needed to sign up for a @National Access Data Plan@ was left out of the conversation I had with Customer Support, and I ended up getting charged by -the-minute for a feature of my cell phone I wasn't even using.

We figured that one out after a couple hours on the phone with Customer Support, and at the end of it, had arranged for them to:

* Credit the bill for the overages
* Sign me up for the @National Access Data@ plan

This was all fine and dandy, but for some reason *we still had to pay the taxes on the incorrect > $1000 charge*. This is pretty shady business if you ask me.

So this month, the bill comes, and it appears as if *they incorrectly setup the @National Access Data@*, and I'm still being charged by the minute for Data use on my Blackberry! 

What _really_ is aggrivating though is that, right as I got off the plane in Bozeman, MT last week, I called Verizon's friendly 611 Customer Service to verify that I wouldn't incur *roaming* charges for Data access. They *assured me that I the @National Access Data@ plan that I carried was just that (National) and that I would incur no fees above* the roaming phone calls I made. The plan is even *listed* on the bill:

bq. @ Unlim. Blackberry, Mobile Web @ <br /> @ Monthly Charge: $49.99 @ <br /> @ Unit Allowance Unlimited kb @

There are charge for $4.50 worth of roaming phone calls. But this is dwarfed by the *7682 minutes* that I am somehow being charged for using the Data part of my Blackberry. 

There's no excuse for this. These guys are idiots, and it offends me to hear them say _"We never stop working for you..."_ a million times when *I'm working to fix their problem*. It's obvious their customer base is so huge they just _don't care_ about the little guy.
